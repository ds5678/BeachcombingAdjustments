# Beachcombing Adjustments

This mod for *The Long Dark* allows you to change the loot table for beachcombing. Requires ModSettings.

## In-Depth Explanation of Interloper container loot tables

On Interloper, rather than creating a separate set of loot tables, certain forbidden items are filtered out at runtime making the other nonforbidden items more likely. This includes flare shells, broken arrows, and the improvised knife. These items which spawn on beaches at lower levels are excluded from Interloper normally. The 3 settings below allow the user to exempt them from being filtered out of the beachcombing loot table.

## Available Item Additions

1.  Improvised Knife    - Re-enables knives on interloper beachcombing.
2.  Broken Arrow        - Re-enables broken arrows on interloper beachcombing.
3.  Flare Shell         - Re-enables flare shells on interloper beachcombing. Pairs nicely with [Cannery Manufacturing](https://github.com/ds5678/CanneryManufacturing/releases).
4.  Rifle               - How? I don't know. Divine intervention. Only applies to games where rifles can spawn.
5.  Revolver            - See above. Only applies to games where revolvers can spawn.
6.  Revolver Ammo       - Slightly more probable than rifle ammo. Only applies to games where revolvers can spawn.
7.  Coffee Tin          - A single tin of coffee. Might be in a ruined state if spawned late-game.
8.  Box of Herbal Tea   - A single box of herbal tea bags. Might be in a ruined state if spawned late-game.
9.  E-Stim              - Tied with several others (including the rifle and revolver) for being the least probable item.
10. Reishi Mushroom     - Reishi Mushrooms wash up on shore. Same probability as birch bark.
11. Rose Hip            - A single rose hip.
